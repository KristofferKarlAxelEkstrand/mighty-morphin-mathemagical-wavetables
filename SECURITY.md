## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value the security of our users and contributors. If you’ve found a vulnerability:

- **Where to report:**  
  Please open a new *issue* or start a *discussion* in the Security category. Preferably mark it as security-related.  
- **Response Time:**  
  Because this project is maintained by volunteers, response times and patches may take up to **6 months**. We appreciate your patience and understanding!
- **DIY fixes welcome:**  
  Is your vulnerability something you can fix yourself? Fantastic! Feel free to submit a PR with your patch (especially since this whole project run locally).
- **On acceptance/decline:**  
  We’ll do our best to update you along the way. If fixes are accepted, they’ll be merged and released in the next supported version update.
